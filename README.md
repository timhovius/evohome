# Evohome Sample Spring Boot Application
This project contains a sample how you can access the evohome API. You can clone this one and use the [ThermostatService](src/main/java/com/evohome/thermostat/service/ThermostatService.java) to access your evohome thermostat.

## How to start
- Add your credentials to [application.yml](src/main/resources/application.yml)
- Create a request (you can find some sample requests in [ThermostatServiceTest](src/test/java/com/evohome/thermostat/service/ThermostatServiceTest.java))
